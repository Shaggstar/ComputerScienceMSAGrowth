Investigating a possible relationship between a university's computer science department rank, and surrounding urban growth

Much has been written about skilled labor and the impact this has on urban growth (Glaeser 2003). 
Additionally there is increasing debate about the cost and benefit of higher education. 
This analysis seeks to isolate and determine whether a single higher educational ranking, i.e. the ranking of a 
Universityâ€™s Computer Science Department (CS), is a causal attribute that alone contributes to growth. 
Cities such as Austin, TX, and Durham, NC, have recently seen an influx in high tech businesses flocking to attract 
the highly valued skills the CS programs are producing. This has seemingly created a dynamic growth environment 
in cities that had been in decline, or in some cases missed previous boons generally.  


The change is visible, the impact on municipalities via tax revenues and employment growth is paramount.
In other words, if we can predict that a University with a highly ranked CS program is predictive in urban growth, 
would not a municipality give serious consideration to make the required investment in time and resources?
